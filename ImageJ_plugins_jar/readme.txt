To install plugins, you can copy entire 4 folders into:
ImageJ_your_local_dir/plugins/ folder. 

To update Spatial3DTissueJ plugin, simple replace your current version by a latest version in spatial3dtissuej_plugin folder.

For 3D viewer, you can copy 3dviewer plugins folder into your plugins directory
or install latest 3d viewer plugin from Fiij
Note: if the program do not work, the main issue may be due lack of supporting packages from 3D viewers. In this case, you can delete your current 3d viewer version, and replaced by the folder that I provided in this github

For Fiji_plugins.jar you can use the latest version in your local ImageJ

When launching ImageJ, platform will notice you a plugin with multiple versions in plugins folder, and overwrite it using one version. In this case, you can go into your local ImageJ/plugins folder, and remove one old version of plugin
