Installation: 

First, you can copy these 3 folders into Fiji/plugins/ or ImageJ/plugins/ and quick check if there is any duplicate plugin, ex: 3DViewerXXXvXXX.jar, Fiji_PluginXXX.jar. You can delete and keep only one version. 

To update plugins, you can delele the folder 3D_suite/ and replace by the most updated folder from my github. 
Have fun!
