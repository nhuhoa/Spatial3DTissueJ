Tissue Organization Analysis Plugin<br>

<p>We provide a toolbox to segment and analyze tissues in 3D. <br>
Tissue Analysis Plugin is a toolbox which allow to analyze <br>
cells and nuclei and explore the spatial structure of tissue. <br>
This toolbox is developed by Thomas's group.<br>
The goal is to suggest a workflow in order to choose a set of <br>
optimal methodologies for quantification and modeling of tissue <br>
organization based on 3D microscopy images.</p>
<p>This ImageJ plugin toolbox is easy access to biologist. <br>
The tissue toolbox was used to analyze endocrine cells in a paper:<br>
“A novel toolbox to investigate tissue spatial organization <br>
applied to the study of the islets of Langerhans”.(Scientific Reports)<br>
