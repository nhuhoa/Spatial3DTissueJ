Tissue Organization Analysis Plugin
We provide a toolbox to segment and analyze tissues in 3D. Tissue Analysis Plugin is a toolbox which allow to analyze cells and nuclei and explore the spatial structure of tissue. This toolbox is developed by Thomas's group.The goal is to suggest a workflow in order to choose a set of optimal methodologies for quantification and modeling of tissue organization based on 3D microscopy images.
This ImageJ plugin toolbox is easy access to biologist. The tissue toolbox was used to analyze endocrine cells in a paper:
“A novel toolbox to investigate tissue spatial organization applied to the study of the islets of Langerhans”.(Scientific Reports)
